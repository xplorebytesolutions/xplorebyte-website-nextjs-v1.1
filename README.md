This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Lead Capture (Book a Demo / Talk to Sales)

This repo includes a Postgres-backed API endpoint to store demo/sales requests:

- Create the table in your Postgres DB using `db/lead_submissions.sql`
- Set `DATABASE_URL` in your local environment (see `env.example`)
- Forms will POST to `POST /api/leads` and insert rows into `lead_submissions`

### Troubleshooting

- If the live site shows “Database connection failed”, verify the deployed environment has `DATABASE_URL` set correctly and your Postgres provider allows inbound connections from your hosting provider (some require disabling IP allowlists or whitelisting egress IPs).
- If your provider requires SSL, set `DATABASE_SSL=true` (or set `PGSSLMODE=require` in the connection string/environment).
- To validate DB connectivity from your machine, run `npm run test:leads:db` (adds a test row; pass `--cleanup` to delete it).

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
