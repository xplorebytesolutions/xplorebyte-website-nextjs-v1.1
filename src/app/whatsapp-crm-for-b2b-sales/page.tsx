                Why B2B sales teams need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                B2B sales win on speed and trust. Dealers, distributors, and
                buyers message for product specs, pricing, quotations, and
                delivery timelines. If replies are delayed—or the conversation
                is lost—deals go to a competitor. WhatsApp CRM gives you a
                structured way to manage conversations like a real business
                workflow.
