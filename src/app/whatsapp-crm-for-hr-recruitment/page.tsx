                Why recruitment teams need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Recruitment wins on speed and communication. Candidates message
                for job details, interview slots, and status updates. If
                replies are delayed—or the conversation is lost—they accept
                another offer. WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured way to
                manage conversations like a real business workflow.
