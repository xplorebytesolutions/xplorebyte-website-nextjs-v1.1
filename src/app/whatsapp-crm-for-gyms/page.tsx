    question: "What is a WhatsApp CRM for gyms?",
    answer:
      "A WhatsApp CRM for gyms helps you manage gym inquiries, memberships, renewals, class bookings, and member history directly on WhatsApp. It connects leads, conversations, and outcomes so your team can respond faster and retain more members.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I increase membership renewals with WhatsApp reminders?",
    answer:
      "Yes. With WhatsApp Business API, you can send automated renewal reminders before expiry, special renewal offers, and reactivation campaigns for dropped members—all trackable and structured.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can multiple staff reply from one WhatsApp number?",
    answer:
      "Yes. With WhatsApp Business API and a Team Inbox, multiple gym staff—front desk, trainers, managers—can handle chats from one number with assignment, ownership, and visibility—so no inquiry is missed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I automate trial pass follow-ups?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A no-code chatbot can handle trial pass inquiries, capture details (preferred batch, fitness goals), send trial confirmation, and route high-intent leads to staff for membership conversion.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can chatbots answer pricing/timings and hand off to staff?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Chatbots can handle FAQs like gym timings, membership plans, class schedules, and pricing—then hand off to a trainer or sales rep for personalized follow-up and closure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need WhatsApp Business API for a gym CRM?",
    answer:
      "For multi-agent inbox, automation, templates, renewal reminders, and scalable campaigns with tracking, WhatsApp Business API is typically required. XploreByte is built around WhatsApp Business API workflows.",

                Why gyms need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Gyms win on speed and experience. Leads message for pricing,
                trial passes, batch timings, and membership plans. If replies
                are delayed—or the chat is lost—they join a competitor. WhatsApp
                CRM gives you a structured way to manage conversations like a
                real business workflow.
