                Why interior designers need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Interior design wins on trust and responsiveness. Clients
                message for quotations, project updates, design ideas, and
                timelines. If replies are delayed—or the conversation is
                lost—they move to another designer. WhatsApp CRM gives you a
                structured way to manage conversations like a real business
                workflow.
