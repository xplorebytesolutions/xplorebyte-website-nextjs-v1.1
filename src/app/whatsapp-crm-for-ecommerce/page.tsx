    question: "What is a WhatsApp CRM for e-commerce businesses?",
    answer:
      "A WhatsApp CRM for e-commerce helps you manage order inquiries, COD confirmations, abandoned cart recovery, customer support, and order updates directly on WhatsApp. It connects orders, conversations, and outcomes so your team can respond faster and increase conversions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I reduce COD returns with WhatsApp confirmations?",
    answer:
      "Yes. By sending COD order confirmations on WhatsApp and getting customer acknowledgment before dispatch, you can significantly reduce fake orders and RTO (Return to Origin) rates.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I recover abandoned carts with WhatsApp campaigns?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can send personalized abandoned cart recovery messages with product images, discount codes, and quick buy links—using opt-in and structured messaging on WhatsApp Business API.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can multiple agents handle customer support from one WhatsApp number?",
    answer:
      "Yes. With WhatsApp Business API and a Team Inbox, multiple support agents can handle customer chats from one number with assignment, ownership, and visibility—so no customer query is missed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can chatbots handle FAQs and hand off to agents?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A no-code chatbot can handle common FAQs (order status, return policy, shipping), capture customer details, and route complex queries to the right support agent for personalized assistance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need WhatsApp Business API for e-commerce automation?",
    answer:
      "For multi-agent inbox, automation, templates, abandoned cart recovery, and scalable campaigns with tracking, WhatsApp Business API is typically required. XploreByte is built around WhatsApp Business API workflows.",

                Why e-commerce businesses need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                E-commerce wins on speed and trust. Customers message for order
                updates, COD confirmations, product inquiries, and support. If
                replies are delayed—or the conversation is lost—they abandon
                carts or order from competitors. WhatsApp CRM gives you a
                structured way to manage customer conversations like a
                professional e-commerce workflow.
