    question: "What is a WhatsApp CRM for clinics and doctors?",
    answer:
      "A WhatsApp CRM for clinics and doctors helps you manage patient inquiries, appointment bookings, follow-ups, and medical reports directly on WhatsApp. It connects patient conversations, history, and outcomes so your team can respond faster and provide better care coordination.",

  {
    question: "Can I automate replies for clinic hours, fees, and services?",
    answer:

    question: "Do clinics need WhatsApp Business API?",
    answer:
      "For multi-agent inbox, automation, templates, and scalable messaging with tracking, WhatsApp Business API is recommended. XploreByte is built around WhatsApp Business API workflows for healthcare.",

                Why clinics and doctors need WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Clinics win on trust and responsiveness. Patients message for appointments, consultation fees, reports, and prescriptions. If replies are delayed—or the chat is lost—patients book elsewhere. WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured, compliant way to manage patient conversations like a real healthcare workflow.
