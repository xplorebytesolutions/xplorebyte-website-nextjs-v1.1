    question: "Can multiple agents handle one WhatsApp number?",

    question: "Can chatbots qualify leads and route to advisors?",

                Why financial service teams need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Financial services win on trust and responsiveness. Clients
                message for loan eligibility, policy details, EMI schedules, and
                document requirements. If replies are delayed—or the
                conversation is lost—they move to another advisor or lender.
                WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured way to manage conversations
                like a real business workflow.
