                Why event planners need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Event planning wins on speed and trust. Clients message for
                venue options, packages, pricing, and availability. If replies
                are delayed—or the conversation is lost—they book with a
                competitor. WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured way to manage
                conversations like a real business workflow.
