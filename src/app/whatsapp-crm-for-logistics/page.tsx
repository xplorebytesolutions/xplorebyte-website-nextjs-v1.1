                Why logistics businesses need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Logistics wins on speed and clarity. Customers message for
                pickup scheduling, delivery updates, quotations, and issue
                resolution. If replies are delayed—or the conversation is
                lost—customers switch to another provider. WhatsApp CRM gives
                you a structured way to manage conversations like a real
                business workflow.
