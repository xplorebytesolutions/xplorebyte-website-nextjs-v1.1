                Why restaurants need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Restaurants win on speed and experience. Customers message for
                menu details, reservations, delivery status, and offers. If
                replies are delayed—or orders are mishandled—they order from a
                competitor. WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured way to manage
                conversations like a real business workflow.
