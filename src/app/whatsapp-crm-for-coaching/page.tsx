    question: "What is a WhatsApp CRM for coaching institutes?",
    answer:
      "A WhatsApp CRM for coaching institutes helps you manage student inquiries, admissions follow-ups, demo class bookings, and student history directly on WhatsApp. It connects leads, conversations, and outcomes so your team can respond faster and enroll more students.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can multiple counselors reply from one WhatsApp number?",
    answer:
      "Yes. With WhatsApp Business API and a Team Inbox, multiple counselors and trainers can handle chats from one number with assignment, ownership, and visibility—so no inquiry is missed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I automate replies for course details and pricing?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A no-code chatbot can handle FAQs, capture details (course interest, location, budget), and route high-intent leads to the right counselor for personalized follow-up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run WhatsApp campaigns for batch launches and offers?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can send broadcasts for new batch announcements, early bird offers, fee reminders, and re-engagement campaigns—using opt-in and structured messaging on WhatsApp Business API.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does WhatsApp analytics help coaching institutes?",
    answer:
      "Analytics helps you track response time, campaign engagement, replies, and outcomes (demo booked vs enrolled). This improves follow-ups, counselor accountability, and enrollment campaigns.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do coaching institutes need WhatsApp Business API?",
    answer:
      "For multi-agent inbox, automation, templates, and scalable campaigns with tracking, WhatsApp Business API is typically required. XploreByte is built around WhatsApp Business API workflows.",

                Why coaching institutes need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Coaching institutes win on speed and trust. Students and
                parents message for course details, batch timings, fees, and
                demo classes. If replies are delayed—or the conversation is
                lost—they enroll elsewhere. WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured
                way to manage conversations like a real business workflow.
