    question: "What is a WhatsApp CRM for travel agents?",
    answer:
      "A WhatsApp CRM for travel agents helps you manage travel inquiries, bookings, itinerary sharing, follow-ups, and customer history directly on WhatsApp. It connects leads, conversations, and outcomes so your team can respond faster and close more bookings.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I manage multiple agents on one WhatsApp number?",
    answer:
      "Yes. With WhatsApp Business API and a Team Inbox, multiple travel agents can handle chats from one number with assignment, ownership, and visibility—so no lead is missed.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can I automate inquiry qualification and route to the right agent?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A no-code chatbot can handle initial inquiries, capture travel preferences (destination, budget, dates), and route qualified leads to the right agent for personalized itinerary planning.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I run seasonal travel offer campaigns on WhatsApp?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can send seasonal offers, holiday packages, last-minute deals, and re-engagement campaigns—using opt-in and structured messaging on WhatsApp Business API.",

  {
    question:
      "Do I need WhatsApp Business API for automation and tracking?",
    answer:
      "For multi-agent inbox, automation, templates, campaigns, and tracking, WhatsApp Business API is typically required. XploreByte is built around WhatsApp Business API workflows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I track response time and conversion outcomes?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Analytics helps you track response time, campaign engagement, replies, and outcomes (booking confirmed vs not interested). This improves follow-ups, agent accountability, and conversion campaigns.",

                Why travel agents need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Travel wins on speed and trust. Customers message for packages,
                itineraries, pricing, and availability. If replies are
                delayed—or the conversation is lost—they book with a competitor.
                WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured way to manage conversations
                like a real business workflow.
