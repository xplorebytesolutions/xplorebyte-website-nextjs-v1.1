    question: "What is a WhatsApp CRM for real estate?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "Can multiple agents reply from one WhatsApp number?",

  {
    question: "Can I automate replies for property inquiries and pricing?",

    question: "Can I run WhatsApp campaigns for property launches and offers?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can send broadcasts for new launches, price drops, open house invites, and re-engagement campaigns—using opt-in and structured messaging on WhatsApp Business API.",

  },
  {
    question: "Do real estate businesses need WhatsApp Business API?",
    answer:
      "For multi-agent inbox, automation, templates, and scalable campaigns with tracking, WhatsApp Business API is typically required. XploreByte is built around WhatsApp Business API workflows.",

                Why real estate teams need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Real estate wins on speed and trust. Leads message for property
                details, site visits, pricing, and availability. If replies are
                delayed—or the conversation is lost—buyers move to another
                broker. WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured way to manage
                conversations like a real business workflow.
