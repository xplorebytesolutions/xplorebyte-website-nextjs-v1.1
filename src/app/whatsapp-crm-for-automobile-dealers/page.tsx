                Why automobile dealers need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Automobile businesses win on speed and trust. Customers message
                for vehicle details, test drives, pricing, service
                appointments, and offers. If replies are delayed—or the chat is
                lost—buyers move to another dealer. WhatsApp CRM gives you a
                structured way to manage conversations like a real business
                workflow.
