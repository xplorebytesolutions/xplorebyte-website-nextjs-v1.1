                Why education businesses need a WhatsApp CRM
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Education wins on speed and trust. Parents and students message
                for course details, fees, batch timings, and demo classes. If
                replies are delayed—or the chat is lost—they join a competitor.
                WhatsApp CRM gives you a structured way to manage conversations
                like a real business workflow.
